A group of like-minded community members met together with a zeal to do something for the Mumbaii gyati and to maintain it. That sow the seeds of <b>The Modh Chaturvedi Rajyagor Samavaya Mumbai Gyati</b> which has been flourishing over the years. 
In 2005, these like-minded community members formed a team. The team had a difficult task in their hand. There was no list of our community members residing in and around Mumbai. There was not even a count. Very few community members were aware of other members residing in Mumbai.<u>(see Note 1)</u><br><br>

The team took up the first job of identifying the community members residing in and around Mumbai. This was accomplished by almost visiting each and every house and collecting their names, addresses and contact details. This information was compiled in the form of a small book, which was hand-delivered to each community members. The response received was overwhelming. The small book could be carried in pocket and provided contact details, in user friendly manner.
<br><br>
Guess what! The interaction between the community members increased. This move was appreciated not only by Mumbai community members but there was a huge demand of this small book even from other parts of Gujarat such as Bhavnagar, Amreli, Shihor, Palitana, Ahemedabad and so on.
<br><br>
The stock was exhausted much sooner, much to the delight of the team.

<br><br><br><u>Note 1 :</u> Although the Mumbai Gyati had some get together in the past, the continuity could not be maintained.
